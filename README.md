## Introduction

With the rise of misinformation, detecting fake news has become increasingly important. This project aims to develop a model that can classify news articles as fake or real, using various machine learning techniques and natural language processing.

## Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. It contains:

- News articles
- Labels indicating whether each article is real or fake
- Various textual features for analysis

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayush2102/Fake_News_Detection.git
   cd Fake_News_Detection
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you donâ€™t have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk seaborn jupyter
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook FakeNewsDetection.ipynb
   ```

2. Execute the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's effectiveness in classifying news articles.

## Key Findings

- **Accuracy**: The model achieved an accuracy of 55.01%.
- **Feature Importance**: Certain features were found to be more influential in distinguishing between real and fake news.
- **Confusion Matrix**: The confusion matrix illustrates the model's classification performance.

## Conclusion

The fake news detection model demonstrates promising results in classifying news articles. This can help in combating misinformation and promoting media literacy.
